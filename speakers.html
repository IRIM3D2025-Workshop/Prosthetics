                        <p>Marco Controzzi is Associate Professor at the BioRobotics Institute, Scuola Superiore Sant’Anna (SSSA). His research focuses on the design of artificial hands and advanced prosthetic systems, with a particular emphasis on human grasping and the interaction between human behavior and robotic control. He received his BSc and MSc in Mechanical Engineering in 2005 and 2008, and a PhD in Robotics and ICT from SSSA in 2013. In 2009, he founded Prensilia Srl, a spin-off company that develops and commercializes robotic hands.</p>

                        <p>Simone&nbsp;Traverso&nbsp;is Project Team Leader and Senior Mechanical Engineer at the&nbsp;Rehab Technologies Lab (INAIL-IIT Joint Lab), Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Genoa, Italy. Simone&nbsp;holds a&nbsp;Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering&nbsp;from the&nbsp;University of Genoa. His current research interests span&nbsp;rehabilitation robotics,&nbsp;prostheses&nbsp;and&nbsp;exoskeletons&nbsp;design, and the integration of engineering solutions with user-centered clinical needs. His contributions lie at the intersection of&nbsp;mechanical&nbsp;and&nbsp;biomedical design, with the aim of improving comfort, adaptability, functionality of prosthetic and assistive technologies. At IIT, he leads activities on the development of the&nbsp;Omnia prosthesis, which leverages on semi-actuation concepts. Within Omnia, his team has designed&nbsp;Unico, an active knee prosthesis integrating hydraulic and electric actuation, and&nbsp;Armonico, a micro-controlled ankle prosthesis. He also leads the&nbsp;FeatherEXO&nbsp;project, dedicated to the development of lightweight, soft lower-limb exoskeletons for individuals with locomotor impairments. His earlier works include the co-design of the&nbsp;Hannes prosthetic hand, a highly functional upper-limb prosthesis, and the&nbsp;Twin exoskeleton, a second-generation wearable device for gait assistance with spinal cord injury users. Across these projects,&nbsp;Simone&nbsp;has been deeply involved in&nbsp;mechatronic research, ensuring the transition of prototypes to clinical applications. He is engaged in&nbsp;technology transfer&nbsp;projects and entrepreneurial ventures aimed at translating developed solutions into the medtech industry. Within the lab, he has helped secure several national and international industrial design awards, including the recent&nbsp;Compasso d’Oro International&nbsp;and the&nbsp;iF Design Award.</p>
